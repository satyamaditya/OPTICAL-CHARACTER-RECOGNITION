``` Project - Extract Invoice number, Invoice date, line items from Invoice images. ```


#### Project Details

Hello,
MySelf Aditya. After my research toward this assignment, I found this to be the problem of OCR (OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION).

Basically, the work of OCR is to transform &amp; extract the data from semi-structured (BILLs, INVOICES) or un-structured (CONTRACT, LEGAL DOCUMENTS) to structured format(CSV, EXCEL, XML, DATABASES). By this project I got some idea about REAL-LIFE Problems, the problem of entire enterprise in data entry. Data entry is pretty expensive &amp; time consuming. Here comes the OCR that creates an environment without manual data entry. 90% of stuffs can be configured by OCR &amp; humans will only interrupt when accuracy is not good or some intervention is required.

TOOLS of OCR are available in the market like- ABBYY, ROSSUM, AUTOMATION ANYWHERE, XTRACTA. For the sake of Assignment, I did this Project with the help of CV2 (Computer Vision) and PYTESSERACT (python library for OCR). ''' ''' the main problem with this project is that we dont have any similar kind of format or structure, [things can be done- REGEX or ROI]  initially I was looking for regex to solve this problem, but again due to variation in every format, I can just fetch the invoice date automatically by regex. if I show you the images, we can fetch each given date by REGEX then store it in list, we know that invoice date will be stored firstly &amp; be the index 0. And  hence we can easily fetch 0th index element every time &amp; append it in CSV. But the problem arrives in remains 2 that  we don't have any common starting point or end point hence we can't apply regex here......


Thanking you
